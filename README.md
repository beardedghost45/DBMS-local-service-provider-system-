# DBMS-local-service-provider-system-
This Local Service Provider Management System is in PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. Talking about the features of this system, it contains the admin section and the user (customer or service provider) section. All the editing, updating, managing bookings, and service providers are from the admin section while customers can only go through the site and make bookings if want. The design of this system is simple so that the user wonâ€™t get any difficulties while working on it.
The user can be either a customer who needs home services or a service provider who performs home services. In order to register as a service provider, the user has to fill up the registration form. Whereas, to book the service provider as a customer, the user can first search for the available service provider and then book them. This project makes a convenient way for customers to book service providers, without having to go to the required service center.
